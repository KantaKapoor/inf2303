A syllabus for a free / open source software course
INF 2303- COURSE PATCH

I am suggesting these modifications to the “INF2303: Special Topics
Understanding Open Source Software” from the Librarian’s perspective. During my long-term career as librarian, I faced various challenges of choosing software for different library related activities viz. integrated library system, electronic resources management, eprints, ETD and many others. I along-with my colleagues faced dilemmas of selecting proprietary or open source software. Before joining this course, I always had my own apprehension for opting open source software, because of lack of support. This course has given me a broad overview  of functioning of Open Source Software and their  feasibility in various applications, which I am able to relate to library applications also. Additionally, The course has increased my awareness about the availability of third party support for the open source software.

As the I-School mainly produces librarians, I think it will be a good idea if the course curriculum adds an element specifically for the use of Open source software in libraries. This may include in-depth examination of at-least one available leading OSS pertains to libraries in addition to critical evaluation of its features and discussion regarding how non-programmers can help to contribute to its development. The course schedule may include a couple of guest lectures delivered by experienced librarians who might be using OSS for the libraries’ applications. This practice will give an overview of the procedure followed, challenges faced and the strategies adopted to make the implementation of OSS a success. I think this firsthand information would help the working librarians and potential librarians in the class to select suitable, cost-effective software solution for their respective organizations. In addition, these guest lectures would help the students to learn how to be part of the community and how their contribution would help them in their professional development.

In my opinion, Adoption Case Studies (Wednesday, August 14, 2013) may be replaced with the case studies of libraries successfully using OSS. This may also include some of the examples of failure in implementation of OSS. These case studies would definitely give a clear idea of how to proceed and would help students to learn from their mistakes while working in their profession.
